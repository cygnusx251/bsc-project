# bsc-project

This is a repository created to store important things related to my BSc project on Summer Semester 2022 at Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur Math. I am now working on Numerical methods for solving first order PDEs (especially Linear Advection equation) and have plans to work on the same for Nonlinear PDEs (Burger's equation).
